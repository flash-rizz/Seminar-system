These sequence diagrams are rendered PNGs that match the current Java Swing flow in this repo (and the OOAD lab deliverables asking for multiple sequence diagrams).

- `04-coordinator-create-session.png` — coordinator creates a `Session` with time slot
- `05-coordinator-assign-session.png` — coordinator assigns `Student` / `Evaluator` to a `Session`
- `06-evaluator-submit-evaluation.png` — evaluator submits an `Evaluation` for a session
- `07-coordinator-award-nomination.png` — coordinator computes awards + top 3 rankings
